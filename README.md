# luau-result
When you hate luau's error handling but don't want to import the entire [utils.luau](https://github.com/lukadev-0/util.luau)

## Note
- This module is direct copy of [utils.luau/result](https://github.com/lukadev-0/util.luau/blob/main/packages/result/init.luau) and minified using `darklua`

## When to use
- You hate pure luau's error handling which lacks customizing (such as `Result::map_err`)
- When you suddenly want to use `Result` in luau
- When you feel `utils.luau` is too much for my simple ass luau/lune script
- Seems `Option` can be simply replaced by `?` type in luau
- Seems `Future` is too much for simple luau/lune script
